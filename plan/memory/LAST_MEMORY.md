# Agent Working Memory — Last Session

- Milestone: M0 — Project Setup (verification)
- Sources reviewed: 
  - plan/milestones/M0-Project-Setup.md
  - PRD.docx (extracted text)
  - llm.txt
- Outcome: M0 considered complete based on repository state; proceed to M1 after local build/signing verification.

## What I Did
- Validated presence of app target and placeholder UI (`Pressi/PressiApp.swift`, `Pressi/ContentView.swift`).
- Confirmed scaffolding for modules and tests:
  - Engine stub at `Pressi/Engine/EngineCore.swift`.
  - Action Extension scaffold at `Pressi/Extensions/ActionExtension/`.
  - Unit tests in `PressiTests/`, UI tests in `PressiUITests/`.
- Checked build/test scripts: `scripts/build.sh`, `scripts/test.sh`.
- Reviewed `Pressi.xcodeproj` for shared scheme (`Pressi`).

## Decisions & Notes
- PRS-001 (targets/platforms): Satisfied — simulator‑runnable skeleton present.
- PRS-002 (SPM/module scaffold): Satisfied — placeholders compile conceptually; no external SPM deps needed yet.
- PRS-003 (schemes/signing): Scheme present; per‑developer signing must be verified locally in Xcode.
- PRS-004 (CI bootstrap): Local scripts present; CI workflow can be added later.

## Next Task Proposal
- Milestone: M1 — Architecture & UI Skeleton.
- Completed in this session: PRS-010 (architecture foundation) and PRS-011 (navigation skeleton).
- Next up: PRS-012 (State containers integration with engine), PRS-013 (error model), PRS-014 (theming).
- Prereq: Run a clean local build/test to confirm signing and simulator configuration.

## Pointers for Next Session
- Read: `plan/milestones/M1-Architecture-UI-Skeleton.md` and `plan/architecture.md`.
- Code entry points: `PressiApp.swift`, `Pressi/UI/RootView.swift`, stores in `Pressi/AppState/`.
- Where to document: update `AGENTS.md` if architecture conventions evolve; keep this memory file updated with key decisions.

## What I Did (M1)
- Added app state containers:
  - `Pressi/AppState/SettingsStore.swift` (defaults, compression level)
  - `Pressi/AppState/JobsStore.swift` (job list and progress)
- Added root navigation and views:
  - `Pressi/UI/RootView.swift` with TabView (Home, Settings) and jobs overlay strip
  - `HomeView` quick actions wiring into `JobsStore`
  - `SettingsView` bound to `SettingsStore`
- Wired environment objects in `Pressi/PressiApp.swift` and set root to `RootView()`.
- Wrote `plan/architecture.md` summarizing modules, state flow, and next steps.

# Archive: Docs/Policy Updates (2025-09-04)

- Updated `AGENTS.md` to require committing session changes after build/tests are green and memory/docs are updated.
- Added guidance to update docs when test fixes change behavior; keep tests, code, and docs in sync.
- Introduced `LAST_MEMORY.md` compaction policy; archive older sections to dated files under `plan/memory/` and retain concise summaries with links.
